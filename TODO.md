# Todos

Possible todos for the sample:

* WDI5 TS usage

# FixMe

* Axios doesn't bundle dependencies with new ui5-tooling-modules!

## wdi5

* wdio.conf.ts: Options.Testrunner - extend to include wdi5 config object
* nail TS setup to "test" -> wdio.conf.ts needs to omit "test"

## Unidirectional Flow

* Load data initially, independent from UI
* Model data matches backend data
* Every property update reflects in a backend change
* Synchronize clients via push mechanism
